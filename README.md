**Extras** \
✦ If I don't reply, I'm most likely offtab! Please just drop me a whisper and/or sit in front of me if you'd like to talk. I check back in fairly often but may forget at times. \
✦ Kisses and cuddles from us are NEVER romantic. I'm a very big enjoyer of platonic affection, but please do tell me if it's uncomfortable! \
✦ Feel free to just shorten calling my name Kin, call me Lumu if that's easier to remember \
✦ Just dont be creepy or something and we're fine \
✦ We don't do serious RP on the game, but we Will commit to the character bit as desired \
✦ We freely hide people, no DNI list other than the basic shit and stuff below \
✦ If you still actively engage with Harry Potter or JKR, we request no cosplays or fans of it interact. System introjects/fictives are completely ok \
✦ Don't bring syscourse to us we don't care \
